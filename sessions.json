We are sharing the Learning Portfolio approach with as many schools and organizations as we can to hack, remix, and adapt it to their local context and demystify portfolio development for young webmakers.

Since this is a participatory workshop, participants can create their own unique activities as we progress. We will discuss how much impact tools like this can have on a community and why offline learning is so important. Some examples of activities include:\n1. Learning Web Mechanics with simple card sheets and markers\n2. 'A Strong Wind Blows': a chair game which makes participants wonder about Web\n3. A brief example of 'Web Mechanics Speed Dating'.\n4.

My goals are to convince that JavaScript and the browser are major learning tools even for areas outside of computer science, and to teach people a few examples of how they can leverage the power of the web to develop seemingly complex simulations that run in every browser using open technologies.

The capacity, tools and resources needed by every school to integrate CS concepts are limited.\n \nKim Wilkens & Zach Minster will share their story of integrating CS across the K-12 curriculum at St. Anne’s-Belfield School where being part of the Mozilla Learning Network has been critical to their success. Ann Marie Carrothers will share her story of creating Coding Core, an open-source lesson plan tool that empowers schools to implement CS coursework that goes beyond the #hourofcode while being easily understood by teachers and parents with no tech or CS background.\n \nDuring this session, we are especially interested in learning from other educators, students and parents about their experience of CS - the good, the bad & the ugly, so we can brainstorm steps that can help us all bridge this critical gap in education.",

We set out to map the blank canvas of Tanzania using mobile apps (for locals on the ground), open data (of schools&medical facilities) and satellite mapping on OpenStreetMap (for volunteers around the world). The project has since seen major successes, including thousands of schools mapped, hundreds of objects&villages that were only known to locals identified etc. Currently, we are rushing to map the region of Mara, where female genital mutilation (FGM) is prevalent, before the cutting season starts in December. Mugumu Safe House is already using our maps to \"reach places they have never reached before\" and save more girls from the life threatening practice. Our goal for this session is to demonstrate how mapping can help achieve SDGs in developing countries, and illustrate how easy it is to contribute by doing mapping online.",

Can a board game help the players develop their empathy and relate to others? Can it help them identify with other communities? Can it help build a more inclusive web? \n\nThink of monopoly or other plateau games, and illustrate things like:\n* Visiting a certain number of web pages per day on a data-budget\n* Face network connectivity difficulties\n* Deal with a lack of money while participating in the mobile economy\n* Browse topics written in a language you don't understand\n* Stubble upon content that is not respectful and inclusive \n\nThe goal for this session is to create the mechanisms of the games and eventually make enough progress to plan it's production.",

We want to share this platform, and the importance of municipal broadband, with the world. Pioneering cities and towns have taken it upon themselves to close the digital divide by ensuring affordable, city-wide Internet access through municipal broadband networks. Our platform will build on the successes of these often disparate and isolated communities, and kickstart a new mass movement for municipal broadband initiatives that can be replicated anywhere. In the U.S. alone, over 100 communities have pledged to develop their own fibre, highlighting the role municipal networks can play in galvanizing the digital divide. Participants will receive a preview of our engagement platform to empower not just individuals, but entire communities, to organize in distributed, local groups, and address the digital deficits their cities and towns face.",

After each field trip to various locations in the city (e.g., science museums, technology-oriented organizations), youth documented their visit by dropping a pin on a map and reflecting on the experience via blog posts and photos. This engagement, in addition to helping young people gain familiarity with building personal pathways, represented a powerful way to begin to shape their digital world, increase digital inclusion, build web literacy, and engage with issues of online privacy and security .",

This movement is finally being recognized as a tool for student success and a pathway to connected learning. Making provides the ability to take practical knowledge and create personally relevant projects while engaging learners, but the connection to the classroom and home life is still lacking. Maker MOB aims to reach families unfamiliar with the maker movement to create a community of makers, specifically those underrepresented in the STEM fields using students and Chicago institutions to lead STEM activities at neighborhood events. We believe that bringing these activities to families, where they are at, will create new communities of makers. Session participants will be introduced to the Maker MOB while learning how to replicate within their own communities and build the perceived value of making.",

This content is passed around on a variety of platforms, but what does it mean for open licensing, transparency, and the commons when most things feel free to users even if they aren't open? What does it mean to share the latest viral photo, video, or GIF when you want to work in the open? Why does the distinction between free and open matter?\nThis interactive session will help participants question how and what they share on the Web and why content that's free is not necessarily open. After exploring these issues, participants will dream up a new technology or platform they would utilize or create to make creativity thrive in the open on the Web we want.",

You will then be given a writing brief, and invited to report on the festival for us, uploading to the website at your leisure. Your blogs could be seen by our thousands of readers, and you get to say your blog is posted on Voice! \n\nSo if you want to attend a session that will help you express your opinions, help you review the festival, or if you just want to ask an expert editor and trained journalist some industry tips, this is the session for you!",

Mozart (260th year this year) devised a clever game in the 18th century by throwing dice to make apparently “random” choices from a grid of musical examples. Thus an appropriate example is always selected. Whether or not the dice player understands to the process, s/he will always produce a coherent piece. Using a coded process the “player” can create a piece with even less prior musical knowledge.\n\nThe digital form of the game allows the participant much more flexibility to examine patterns as between music and coding. With a minimum of formal musical knowledge, the participant can gain insights into patterns and how they work.\n\nBe prepared!\nPlease down load the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz__LQ1ATjtWZjdrbjlRYlRxVEU?usp=sharing\nYou’ll need this for maximum participation to compose your own unique piece of music!",

In particular, we will look at computer-assisted tools for annotating medieval manuscripts and summarise the thinking behind our own work on the open source DigiPal framework (digipal.eu). \n\nParticipants will learn about technologies for marking-up manuscripts and how visualisation techniques allow us to further nuance our understanding of the medieval cultures that produced these artefacts.",

Students will discuss the different methods of weather data visualisation, particularly with regards to catering to specific-interest groups. They will draw on their own experiences of a collaborative project run with the Met Office, showcase their own visualisations (both online and offline) and talk about their development. It is hoped that this will provide a framework for discussion about data visualisation in a broader sense, drawing on the perspectives of both scientists and designers. Session participants will hopefully also be inspired by the collaboration between students and industry, potentially leading to further partnership opportunities within the design and scientific communities. Finally the students who won the weather data project will also exhibit a special Moz Fest edition of 'Hack Circus' they co-created with the Met Office.",

Instead data processing takes place ‘on the box’ and is limited to what is needed to deliver specific services. We introduce the Databox platform to the Mozilla community and provide participants with the opportunity to get their hands on this novel privacy-preserving platform. This hands on session will exploit data provided by Internet of Things devices deployed around the Mozilla Festival. Participants will be provided with a brief overview of the Databox platform before being invited to build ‘apps’ that sit on the Databox. Exploiting a modified Node Red app-building environment, participants will discover how to make apps that respect the requirement of informed consent and allow individuals to exercise granular choice over data processing; choices which are translated into enforceable policies on the Databox and govern data access and use.",

Automation is problematic however, creating risks to privacy and impacting trust. This proposal seeks to engage the Mozilla community in understanding the dilemmas that emerge when connected spaces become autonomous. Workshop participants will be introduced to a range of storyboards illustrating utopian and dystopian visions of a future autonomous home. By encouraging participants to reflect on these envisioned futures, our aim is to spark a discussion that will help uncover some of the critical challenges confronting autonomous systems and the kinds of interfaces that are needed by human beings to control these systems. In addition to making an engaging contribution to the Mozilla Festival, the results of the workshop will inform development of the Autonomous Internet of Things http://a-iot.org",

We will talk about Watt’s legacy and show some of the things that came out of his discussions: the first machine for duplicating writing; a new type of organ; a sculpture copying machine. Inspired by Watt’s workshop and inventions, we will take some everyday objects (kettles, vases, scissors, plates, screwdriver, pliers, pen, book, etc.) and thinking about how they could be rethought. We will have a selection of these objects available and will take them apart, look at how they work and discuss how they can be rethought. We will produce some short video presentations on our new inventions.",

The main aims of this workshop will be to present a few of the potential problems of the IoT (e.g., sensor reliability and privacy) in a personal, hands-on and engaging way.\nIn the first part of the workshop, participants will explore the SenseMe toolkit through a series of mysterious, interactive activities involving sensors, LED lights and Bluetooth. These activities will be coupled with discussion about sensor reliability and data privacy in the context of the IoT.\nIn the second half of the workshops, using the Arduino IDE, participants will re-program the toolkit in small groups, creating IoT-inspired applications that take into account the potential IoT problems explored in the first part of the workshop.",

One reason for this is because IoT brings computing power much closer to us physically and more pervasive. There are already examples of how this physical proximity and digital control of physical resources can result in life-threatening scenarios, such as a car being hacked or a pacemaker compromised.\n\nIoT also collects more and different data than previous eras of the internet. This includes our physical location, appearance, and even emotional state.\n\nAs we build meaningful connected things, we must ensure that these objects don’t compromise people’s agency. People must be able to understand and control their digital lives. And control depends on context. We want to understand how designing for specific contexts can inform privacy best practices broadly.",

Although we often see the impact of cuts in spending or shutting down public services, it is often at a point that’s too late to do anything about - perhaps there is a way, through accessible interactive data visualisations, audio-visual projections, haptic enabled interfaces that can help us all better connect the dots.",

The game will be available for self-directed play throughout the weekend.\n\nPlaying this game makes you think about the decision making and ethical dilemmas that a border guard might face while deciding about the fate of migrations. We recommend playing this in small groups of 2-3.\n\nThis is a game for all ages, but we recommend having an adult in the group to provide some context and explanations.",

Did you know in some parts of the EU, teachers aren’t legally allowed to screen films or share teaching materials in the classroom? Think that’s absurd? So do we and we've assembled a panel of experts to talk about what's wrong and what you can do.

We'll talk about the current obstacles/challenges that patents present to open software and open hardware, how patents can expressly permit everyone to openly innovate, and how open source patents can prevent patent trolls or proprietary entities from claiming technologies that are meant for everyone. The more entities that license their software patents to include and encourage open innovation (rather than reserve all rights to exclude) the healthier the open source ecosystem gets.",

Join us for a hands on workshop where we will build our own WebExtensions after a quick introduction to the tools and concepts. WebExtensions are zipped folders comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With today’s WebExtension API, it’s possible to create a single extension that will run in Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. No advanced knowledge of WebExtensions is required but experience building a standard web page is recommended.",

The intangibility of exchanging images, videos, audio clips and data in the form of vines, ebooks, music streaming and so on means that it can be hard for consumers to know their rights in regard to intellectual property. This is often exploited by organisations who rely on intellectual property as part of their business model. An important part of copyright reform is not only a reassessment of the legal rights of consumers, but also a reassessment of how rights are communicated and how consumers are made tangibly aware of their rights in their interactions.\n\nAdditional Facilitators:\nJustin Pickard - Strange Telemetry",

These issues can be opportunities to change “business as usual” by identifying problems and addressing gender/racial equity in our workplaces or activist communities. During this session we will discuss the challenges or barriers to equity and together craft solutions. For those interested in staying connected after the workshop, we will create a slack channel for ongoing peer support.",

And I'll help you one-on-one to write and send off your first FOI request! If you have a certain dataset or record that you're looking for, we'll make sure we tailor the request for specific information. If you don't have data you're looking for, I'll help you think through some datasets you could request.\nThis workshop is for anyone who is interested in data and learning about FOI.\nNote: This session will be mostly focused on American, Canadian, South American and European record requests as that's what I know most about, but I'm always happy to learn new laws, so stop by if you're interested in requesting information from your country and we'll figure it out.",

Both in this stage like in the next (data search, data qualification and data check) we use technology based on natural language analysis. \n\nAfricaCheck.org is the continent's leading fact-checking website. Based in South Africa, our team of journalists and researchers spend hours working with data sources to prepare reports. They are also now regularly contacted by journalists asking for help in finding \"reliable\" data on a wide range of topics. We built a simple tool, on our site, to set out data sources we think useful (not always reliable) and explain pros & cons, but want to share ideas - with both journalists/researchers and UX specialists - about how best to develop this to meet journalists needs.",

Whether you're cleaning and analysing data or creating an intricate graphic, programming requires intense focus and can often leave you feeling drained. What's more, there's always the temptation to stay a little longer and make your project that much better. So how can we counteract those pressures? We're going to present a solution that provides both a much-needed break from technical work, and inspiration for future projects!

We’re looking for journalists to help us understand the challenges they face around using FOI, so that we can build the most useful possible toolkit for making and managing FOI requests. We’ll showcase our in-progress alpha service and will be aiming to recruit new users for our public beta that will be in development until April 2017.",

The fact that we have a latitude and longitude, or region or even just an address for a piece of data allows us to easily bring every other dataset that co-occupies that space into relation with our own data. This makes it incredibly powerful for developing deeper insights in to that data. In addition, most processes in our world have a spatial component, birds flock, diseases spread and your neighbors effect you. Thinking spatially about how the world, applying spatial statistics and prediction methods helps us interpret\nour data better.\nIn this talk I will use a series of open source tools to show how you can easily join your spatial data with other datasets, use that to run spatial statistics models and machine learning based prediction.",

It has two goals: 1) to be the place for solving (big) data problems through open challenges; and 2) to be the place for learning about the techniques used to solve these problems.\nDeveloped by scientists and engineers at EPFL in Switzerland, crowdAI is open to participants from anywhere in the world. The platform is also open to host challenges from anyone else.\nOpen data challenges on the web give everyone around the world a shot at tackling difficult data problems. By providing their solutions openly, participants can rapidly learn the latest powerful techniques from each other. At this session, we will have three talks: 1) What is crowdAI, 2) A typical crowdAI challenge, and 3) Using crowdAI to run a plant disease diagnosis challenge. Thus, people will learn about the platform and how they can use it themselves.",

Participants will learn how these technologies can be used to manage communications and contributions within a team. At the end of the session, the contributions of all participants will be collated and used to produce an overall team plot.\n\nThese very basic skills should form a good foundation for participants to start coordinating collaboration on their own projects and develop their skills further through practice. That's how I learnt!\n\nNB. Participants will get the most out of their session if they bring their own laptops.",

We will demonstrate how you can use knowledge maps not only to discover the literature that you need but also to improve your understanding of the structure of your research area. In short: we want to help you make your literature research more efficient and effective. Finally, we will show you how you can openly share the results of your discovery with others. Because sharing is caring - and the time you and others save on literature research can be used to collaborate.",

Scientific experiments are incremental and thus many published experiments may ask similar questions. Yet, there is a reproducibility crisis. Traditional publishing values novelty over reproducibility and forces a hierarchical story-like structure to the presentation of findings. Building one “paper” can take years but science happens every day! Built using open source tools and incubated in the 2015 open research accelerator at Mozfest, miniReproducibility allows users to submit their own data or any open access figure; annotate and display them non-hierarchically to visualize the experiments and methodologies side-by-side. This provides visibility to the data that is often buried in the middle of a paper. Submitters whether they be readers, publishers, and scientists build a user profile dedicated to methodology and reproducibility using open badges.",

Our web infrastructure is designed to be generalised and deployable by other communities interested in monitoring their own wildlife. \n\nThis is a break from traditional ecological research that's driven by a few \"scientists\", and really takes citizen science into the hands of \"ordinary\" citizens. We hope to share our experience building this platform, but more importantly start a discussion on (1) effective crowdsourcing of classifying large image datasets, perhaps with the use of Open Badges; (2) comparing different citizen science platforms; (3) what it means to be a citizen scientist; (4) and what we wish for these platforms so they can help us be better participating citizens.",

Such as installing tools, compiler, setup configuration, etc. That can be a barrier to learn to code.\nIntroduction will cover the background why we making it, why it important, what we do for it and how it can help many developer / programmer.\nThen, i will give a DVD / participant, so they can try it with live boot mode (without install) or try after the event.\nWe will explore each feature of TeaLinux.\nThe next part is discussion, how this idea can be better, with brainstorming technic using post it. We will discuss each idea and conclude.",

We will also demonstrate various real CK-based experimental scenarios (such as collaboratively benchmarking and tuning Deep Neural Network algorithms and crowdsourcing compiler optimizations),  already used by leading universities and research laboratories, Fortune50 companies, and computer systems' conferences (for artifact evaluation).\nMore information is available at:\n* http://cknowledge.org/repo\n* http://cTuning.org/ae",

Our ambition is to build Open Source, Node.js based tools, which integrate with modern web technologies. We want to provide smooth data access workflows to power health research and to maximise the research impact.\nParticipants will learn how to use Node.js to query and fetch data from the web, how to process it in a real-time and scalable way using Node.js Streams (similar to UNIX pipes). We will focus on genomic data repositories, but the knowledge on fetching data and building complex pipes using Streams is widely transferable. The participants will have the option, and will be incentivized, to publish the developed code as reusable Node.js modules under the Open Source community project Bionode.io. We will follow-up with these participants after the MozFest event.",

Specifically, researchers from CERN and software developers in Kansas City have launched the CERN + KC Gigabit Computing Challenge, using extensive gigabit networking in Kansas City to extend the volunteer compute resources used by LHC@Home to analyze Large Hadron Collider data. While there is an element of fun and virtuousness in simply donating extra compute power to the cause, we want to use this collaboration to develop lesson plans for in-school or out-of-school real-time learning. How can we use this processing power to activate citizen scientists? The intent is that these plans can be implemented as part of Mozilla’s Gigabit Community Fund projects in KC this fall.",

Despite the aparent simplicity to this process be efficent it needs several tweaks, if the soil where the plant lays is way beyond its field capacity and wilting point, or the plant is dieing or water  is being thrown away, if there is not enough sunlight  the plant can't reproduce and complete their life cycle.

The #HackBrexit workshop will give participants the opportunity to contribute to an existing open source project. Organized in collaboration with Code First: Girls, ThoughtWorks and WeRockTech, this project started life as a weekend hackathon on 23-4 July 2016, and has grown into an ongoing open source accelerator programme and fortnightly meetup.\n\nDuring our workshop we’ll introduce the two open source projects that make up the Hack Brexit accelerator and explain ways in which you can get involved. The hands-on portion will include topics in data visualisation, prototyping, web development, design, natural language processing and more! We welcome attendees from all backgrounds as we’ll have space for you here no matter how technical or non-technical you are.\n\nWe want to create a collaboration between artists, designers, thinkers, and makers to tackle the issues around open data that Brexit has brought to light! We will have both digital (open data, APIs, libraries, etc) and non-digital (paper, pens, scissors) resources to make our session as interactive as possible. See you there!",

Since the data analysis is extremely time-consuming, it could take decades before the researchers arrive at actual treatment targets - but with volunteers' help we could speed up this process by orders of magnitude.\n\nStall Catchers is the first of two EyesOnALZ games, and is already available online. In Stall Catchers participants view movies of live mouse brains and try to \"catch\" stalls - clogged blood vessels. By playing the game, participants will help to answer research questions leading up to potential Alzheimer's treatments, thus directly fighting a disease that in one way or another affects everyone.\n\nThe goal of this session is to demonstrate the game & start building the first ever community of #citsci4alz.",

Badges that you don’t realise that’s what they’re doing when you’re earning them.\n#BadgeSkills at O2’s ThinkBigHub this week highlighted:\nThe potential badges can offer alternative routes into and through employment.\nThat resilience and ‘mental toughness’ come up again and again as something employers need in our workforce.\nThat most businesses currently recruit by measuring the wrong qualities (Roger Phily, The Chemistry Group)\nIs it possible that badges can offer an alternative route to value what employers need, but also to develop, recognise and evidence this too?\nThe later in life you experience failure, the bigger the fear. To really develop mental toughness, kids need to be losing their fear of failure at age 6/7/8. But whatever your age (as I’ve personally recently realised) it’s never too late, and can be liberating.",

Funders required us to provide Champions with the opportunity to gain accreditation, however we struggled to find an existing programme which was relevant and meaningful. Open Badges provided the solution. A scheme of 18 skill badges and one meta badge were created to capture and recognise the skills and experiences offered to Champions, such as presenting, meeting decision makers and producing videos.\nParticipants will learn about the project and badge scheme, its practical implementation, its strengths and weaknesses, and the impact it has had on the young people involved. We aim to bring several Champions to Mozfest to share their thoughts and experiences directly, and answer questions as part of the session.",

In oil drilling personnel need to be re-certified every three years and tracking this worldwide brings challenges. The potential for counterfeiting of certificates is high as the industry pay is lucrative. Open Badges are being used as evidence of license to practice as they can be secure and time constrained.\nAlongside this the secure delivery of certificates alone costs nearly £1m per year. Discover how we partnered with a global oil regulator to provide a secure, cost effective, digital solution to their problem.",

The session will begin with a demonstration of the SSSC’s Open Badges platform. Participants will hear about the rationale behind decisions we took during development, including what works well and what we intend to improve on. After this, we’ll explain why learner evidence, usually in the form of reflective statements, is vital if an Open Badge is to be accepted as part of a registered worker’s Continuous Professional Development (CPD) requirement. We’ll share advice and materials participants can use and adapt to help learners create effective evidence for their badge applications. Although the SSSC is a Scottish public body, the discussion will focus on the benefits of Open Badges to professional regulation across the globe.",

How can badges save hiring managers time and lead to a better job fit?\n\nHank Holiday and Benjamin Roome are co-founders of the Open Badge platform Badge List. \nWe are developing a new type of hiring process specifically geared towards matching college students and recent college graduates with entry level job roles. Employers looking to hire for similar entry level jobs will collaborate to create constellations of badges that fit well with the types of badges students earn during their higher ed experience.\n\nWe will begin this hands-on session by explaining the workflow. Then we will guide participants through a design process which is being developed to help streamline the process of finding high quality job candidates for entry-level jobs.\n\nThis session will be relevant to anyone interested in hiring for entry-level positions in their organization. Everyone should bring a laptop and one or more job descriptions. Everyone will leave with a with the knowledge they need to go out to start their own coalition to simplify the process of hiring candidates for entry level jobs.",

The online portfolios are based on employability and academic standards as well as life skills and are powered by student achievement in the academic, arts, business and cultural world.  This portfolio allows prospective employers to see all facets of a student’s achievements by a quick view of their badges and a closer look at their work.  The community (businesses, volunteer agencies and more) is encouraged to participate by creating and awarding badges to students as they move through the different levels of their portfolio each year they are in school. The culminating activity of the portfolio will be an internship their senior year with a local business.",

No experience \nwith code or circuitry is necessary-- everyone is welcome!In this hands-on workshop attendees will learn to create interactive posters with circuitry on paper and make them come to life with Arduino programming!\nWe will be using circuit stickers to build expressive circuitry on paper and introduce a new programmable microcontroller clip for the code. We will be using an online browser-based Arduino programming platform and participants can program the clips with their laptops, tablets or even cell phones.\nOur goal is to introduce beginner circuit builders and programmers to the magic of creating technology through arts and crafts.  Participants will get to have fun designing, building and coding electronics while making unique and expressive works of art!\nFor an example of programmed paper circuitry artwork, check out this interactive painting:\nhttp://technolojie.com/pu-gong-ying-tu-dandelion-painting/",

The aim of the workshop is not teaching children how to play chess, but to let them approach the world of chess with the same curiosity they have when listening to a fairy tale, trying to enter it gradually, until they become part of it\nThe psychomotor practice is a fundamental element for a healthy development of the child, which is favoured by sense-motor play in which “the pleasure of acting enhances the pleasure of thinking”(B. Aucouturier). Furthermore, from last studies on neurosciences, it has been confirmed how psychomotor activity favours learning, speech development and abstract thinking, thus enhancing creativity and social abilities in children.",

We will be using an online browser-based Arduino programming platform and participants can program the clips with their laptops, tablets or even cell phones.\nOur goal is to introduce beginner circuit builders and programmers to the magic of creating technology through arts and crafts.  Participants will get to have fun designing, building and coding electronics while making unique and expressive works of art!\nFor an example of programmed paper circuitry artwork, check out this interactive painting:\nhttp://technolojie.com/pu-gong-ying-tu-dandelion-painting/",

An evolutionary development from a previous 2D film (In my Shoes), the application of technical advances in Virtual Reality filming, Binaural audio and post production enabled the BBC’s Project Cape team to realise this fully immersive experience with a twist; one that is not designed to reflect the real world for the purposes of greater immersion, but to replace an expected experience of the real world with that of another alternative reality. The film is designed to highlight how a Neurodivergent individual interacts with their environment and how that environment subsequently interacts with them.",

A visitor to a gallery or similar, encountering the artwork with the machine installed, is invited to place their hands 'into' the painting, triggering an interactive and unique musical response based on the composer's ideas, and manipulated in real time by the position and motion of their hands.\nA prototype of the machine was demonstrated for the first time at the Langton Festival of Music and Health this July, and will be further developed by the time of MozFest.",

Children will be talking about the hardware and software needed and you will have the opportunity to have a go at operating the robot· the BBC Micro:bit guessing game which was built using Javascript – see if you can beat it by guessing the correct number the fruit/dough keyboard that uses the BBC Micro:bit to produce sounds as programmed by the children",
